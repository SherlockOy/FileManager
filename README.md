FileManager
===========
This is a Java Project which has some functions to operate the files under specific directory. Required to connect the MySql Database.

Be careful when you use the project, it may delete some of your files because of the FunctionCleanfileï¼Œmake sure you use the FunctionScanFile before ohter functions, that would be much safer. 

If there is any bug, please open an issue and discuss with me.

The annotations are all in Chinese, I may clean the code later and add annotations in English later.

At last, forgive my poor English :-)
