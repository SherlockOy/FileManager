FileManager
===========
This is a Java Project which has some functions to operate the files under specific directory. Required to connect the MySql Database.

Be careful when you use the project, it may do something bad to your files.

If there is any bug, please open an issue to discuss with me.

The annotations are all in Chinese, I may clean the code later and add annotations in English later.

At last, forgive my poor English :-)
